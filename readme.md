# Cole's Ruby Engine

A 2d rpg game engine to make games with but my personal reason is use this game engine as a testbed for learning new technologies and integrating everything I know into one project.




## Roadmap

- NPC decision logic

- A menu

- Expand Event system

- Saving / Loading

- Sound

- Online Multiplayer
    - Server allowing players to fight same enemies
    - Party/PVP system
    - Chat
    - Trading

- Deep Learning A.I. Agents on Servers
